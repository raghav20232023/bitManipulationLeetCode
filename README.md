# bitManipulationLeetCode

**Description :**

Implementation of bit manipulation in java in LeetCode questions for questions of varying difficulties.

Note: I strongly suggest the reader to refer to the in code comments if they get stuck anywhere. In the code, necessary comments are written at all the places where someone reading the code might get stuck. All login flow and formulae/implementation is also explained via comments inside the code itself :). The comments will clear all of your doubts.

I would also like to mention that at the same time I have put considerable effort in making sure the code is as clean and readable as possible, and all the variable names are written in English language pertaining to the function they perform.

**Please refer to this readme file for detailed explanations of both code and output.**

**explanation :**

bitwise xor operator : ^

xor of two number with same values always returns 0

xor of a number with 0 always returns the number itself

formula of xor is 

a^b = (a'.b) + (a.b')

linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
